### I. Typography for Elements

Do your best to recreate the styles seen on the Exercise 4 slide for Inline, Block, and Metadata Elements by writing CSS rules for three classes. Think about:

- In what ways does that text differ stylistically from normal text?
- Can I track down the name of those attributes in the CSS property list?
- What property values does each rule appear to be taking?

Write these rules in `ex-4.css` and then link to in the YAML of this file.

### II. A Custom Callout

Create a custom class for your own style of callout box. Properties to look into include:
- borders
- background colors
- padding
